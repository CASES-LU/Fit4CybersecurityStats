<p>As an example this tool allows instantiation of the following self-assessment
websites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://fit4cybersecurity.cases.lu" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fit4Cybersecurity</a>,</li>
<li><a href="https://fit4privacy.cases.lu" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fit4Privacy</a>,</li>
<li><a href="https://operatorsurvey.cases.lu" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OperatorSurvey</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="surveys">Description of the surveys instances</h1>
<h2>Fit4Cybersecurity</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://fit4cybersecurity.cases.lu" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">This survey</a>
is a quick online self-assessment tool helping business owners evaluate their
security maturity and enhance their cyber risk protection.
This is the first step of a more thorough assessment, that we call a Diagnostic
CASES. The latter dives deeper into the organisationâ€™s context, its state of
practice and the existing documentation in terms of cybersecurity risk management,
with the goal to address gaps with respect to baseline practices.</p>

<h2>Fit4Privacy</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://fit4privacy.cases.lu" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">This survey</a>
aims to help organisations assess to what extent they are in control of their personal data risks,
as required by the GDPR since May 2018.</p>

<h2>OperatorSurvey</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://operatorsurvey.cases.lu" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">This survey</a>
aims to identify the level of maturity of the operators in Luxembourg with
respect to risk management and governance, collaboration on national and
EU level and Incident reporting.<br />
The survey will be online and available between <b>December 2021 and April 30th 2022</b>.</p>
